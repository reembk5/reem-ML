Project Summary: Analyzing and Predicting Consumer Behavior1. Project Objectives:This project focused on developing Machine Learning models capable of analyzing Instacart's large-scale datasets to achieve two primary goals:Task A (Classification): Predicting the likelihood of a user reordering a specific product (Yes/No).Task B (Regression): Predicting the time interval (in days) expected until the user places their next order.2. Technical Libraries and Justification for Selection:Pandas & Numpy:Reason: Utilized for data manipulation and structuring, processing large tables, and performing the necessary computational and logical operations for data cleaning and merging.Matplotlib & Seaborn:Reason: Used for data visualization, which facilitated the comparison of performance between different models and provided a clear visual understanding of error distributions (Residuals).Scikit-Learn (Sklearn):Reason: The primary framework for implementing Machine Learning algorithms, specifically:StandardScaler: To normalize feature scales, ensuring model accuracy.Algorithms: To implement various models including Linear, Lasso, Ridge, and Random Forest.Metrics: To evaluate model efficiency using scientific metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$.3. Methodology:Feature Engineering: New characteristics were extracted from user behavior (such as average historical purchase intervals), enabling the models to more accurately understand individual user patterns.System Resource Management: Due to the massive data volume, random sampling techniques and constraints on model complexity (e.g., tree depth) were applied to ensure execution efficiency and processing speed.Model Optimization: The process began with simple linear models and progressed to more sophisticated models like Random Forest, which demonstrated a superior ability to handle non-linear and complex relationships in purchasing data.4. Results and Recommendations:Results indicated that utilizing non-linear models significantly reduces the error rate in predicting future order dates.Practical Application: This system assists retailers in optimizing inventory management and personalizing marketing campaigns for each customer based on their predicted next order time and preferred products.
